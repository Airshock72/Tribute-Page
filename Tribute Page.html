                <h1 id="title">Illidan Stormrage</h1>
                <p>Illidan Stormrage, commonly known as the Betrayer, is the first of the demon hunters, the former self-proclaimed Lord of
                Outland, the former ruler of the Black Temple, and the original leader of the Illidari. He is the twin brother of
                Malfurion Stormrage and was, like his sibling, in love with Tyrande Whisperwind. Originally a powerful night elf
                sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his people by defecting to the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the
                Ancients, though his reasons for doing so were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legion's invasion. He
                eventually returned to the side of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a second Well of Eternity at the end of
                the war caused his people to name him "Betrayer" and imprison him in the Barrow Deeps below Mount Hyjal. There he
                remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev Shadowsong and her Watchers.<br/><br />
                
                When the Legion invaded Azeroth once more during the Third War, Tyrande freed Illidan from his prison in order to have
                him battle the demons once more. He subsequently consumed the fel energies of the Skull of Gul'dan and transformed into
                a demon in order to defeat the dreadlord Tichondrius, an act for which he was banished by Malfurion. After the Legion's
                defeat at the end of the war, Illidan decided to feign allegiance to the demon lord Kil'jaeden by agreeing to destroy
                Kil'jaeden's traitorous creation, the Lich King, as a way to learn more about his true foe: the Burning Legion.
                Although he amassed an army of servants in the form of the naga led by Lady Vashj, Illidan's efforts were stopped by the
                night elves and he was forced to flee to the shattered realm of Outland. There he and his naga gathered new allies in
                the form of the blood elves led by Kael'thas Sunstrider and the Broken draenei led by Akama, and with their aid he
                overthrew Outland's tyrannical ruler Magtheridon to claim the broken realm for his own. Illidan later traveled with his
                allies to the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown for one last attempt to complete Kil'jaeden's mission, but he was
                eventually thwarted and nearly killed by the Lich King's champion, the death knight Arthas Menethil.<br/><br />
                
                Returning to Outland, Illidan dropped all pretense of serving Kil'jaeden and mustered his armyâ€”the Illidariâ€”to begin his
                true war against the Burning Legion. He trained an army of elven demon hunters in his own image and began preparing
                to destroy the Legion world of Argus, but his extreme methods and single-minded focus on his goal led to the alienation
                of his allies Kael'thas and Akama. Through the manipulations of Kil'jaeden, the Alliance and Horde invaded Outland and
                began dismantling Illidan's forces in the belief that he was no better than the demons he claimed to fight. Despite
                succeeding in destroying the demon stronghold of Nathreza, the Betrayer was ultimately cornered and struck down within
                his own sanctum by Akama, a group of Azerothian adventurers, and his vengeful former jailer, Maiev. Maiev subsequently
                brought Illidan's corpse to the Vault of the Wardens so that his spirit could suffer the rest of his eternal sentence.
                There it remained for years until the Legion invaded once more.<br /><br />
                
                A struggle for Illidan's soul ensued between the Legion and the forces of Azeroth, including the remaining Illidari,
                culminating in Illidan's resurrection atop the Nighthold. The Betrayer subsequently joined forces with Azeroth's
                defenders as they battled the Legion across the Broken Shore and within the Tomb of Sargeras. During a battle with
                Kil'jaeden in the Twisting Nether, Illidan used an artifact known as the Sargerite Keystone to open a rift that brought
                the worlds of Azeroth and Argus together. Illidan accompanied Azeroth's champions as they traveled to Argus to battle
                the Legion alongside the Army of the Light, whose leaderâ€”the prime naaru Xe'raâ€”believed that Illidan was the Chosen
                One, a hero of the Light prophesied to end the age of demons. Illidan rejected the idea of having his destiny
                forged for him and killed Xe'ra when the naaru tried to forcibly infuse him with the Light. The Army of the Light
                and their allies eventually assaulted Sargeras' seat of power, Antorus, and freed the captive spirits of the titan
                Pantheon, who imprisoned Sargeras at the Seat of the Pantheon for his transgressions. While the rest of Azeroth's heroes
                returned home to their world, Illidan chose to remain behind, becoming Sargeras' jailor.<br /><br />
                
                Illidan was introduced as a supporting character in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, though he played a far more
                significant role as one of the protagonists, later as one of the two main antagonists (alongside Kil'jaeden) in the
                game's sequel, The Frozen Throne. He made his first appearance in World of Warcraft as a major antagonist with the first
                expansion, The Burning Crusade, serving as the final boss of the Black Temple raid in patch 2.1. Illidan returned as an
                anti-hero in World of Warcraft: Legion alongside his Illidari. He became a primary force towards defeating the Legion,
                siding with the heroes of Azeroth.</p>
